# snake game where the snake (head, tail, middle, corners) is made of png images made with microsoft paint
# i tried to make the game a little bit difficult by increasing the speed of the snake and by moving the food each 30 moves 
# please let me know how i can improve my code and if you like my game project feel free to modify or use it
